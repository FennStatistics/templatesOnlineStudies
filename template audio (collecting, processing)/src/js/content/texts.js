 <p>Dear participant,</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking part in a study conducted by the Department of General Psychology at the University of Freiburg! Please read the information below carefully.</p>

    <p><b>Voluntariness.</b> Your participation in this study is <strong>voluntary</strong>. You may end this online study at any time without providing a reason and without experiencing any disadvantages. To do so, simply close the browser window. However, if you terminate the online study early, you will not be able to complete it and will therefore not be entitled to compensation.</p>
    <p>Participation in this online study <strong>does not involve any unusual burdens or risks</strong> for you. For participating in this study, you will receive the payment amount listed on Prolific.</p>


    <p><b>Anonymization and storage of the data.</b> The data collected as part of this online study will be <strong>fully anonymized</strong> during collection and storage. The collected data will be stored for at least 10 years. Since the data is collected anonymously, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about your identity. For this reason, however, we are also unable to identify your data set after collection, and therefore cannot delete your data. Even if you terminate the online study early, deletion of the data is not possible for the same reason.</p>


    <p><b>Publication of the collected data.</b> Your data will be used <strong>exclusively for scientific purposes</strong>. Any future publication of the data will be in fully anonymized form and also solely for scientific research purposes. The fully anonymized data will be made publicly available, for example, via the Open Science Framework (OSF) and/or GitHub.</p>

    <p><b>Responsibilities.</b> This study follows the <strong>recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Psychological Society (DGPs)</strong> for ensuring quality and transparency in research.</p>
