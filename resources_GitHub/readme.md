## Version Control & Collaboration (Optional but Recommended)

### Git & GitHub Basics

Understanding Git helps with:

* Tracking changes
* Collaboration
* Reproducibility

### Using Source Control in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code has **built-in Git support**, allowing you to manage version control without leaving the editor.

#### Basic Workflow in VS Code

1. **Initialize a Git repository**

   * Open your project folder in VS Code
   * Go to the *Source Control* view (Ctrl+Shift+G)
   * Click **Initialize Repository**

2. **Track file changes**

   * Modified files appear automatically in the Source Control panel
   * Click a file to view a side-by-side diff

3. **Stage changes**

   * Click the **+** icon next to a file to stage it
   * Staging selects what will be included in the next commit

4. **Commit changes**

   * Write a short commit message describing what you changed
   * Click **Commit** (✔)

5. **Connect to GitHub**

   * Use *Publish to GitHub* (bottom status bar or Source Control view)
   * Authenticate once and VS Code handles the setup

6. **Pull & Push updates**

   * **Pull** to get changes from GitHub
   * **Push** to upload your commits

#### Why This Matters for Online Studies

* Keep track of changes to all files for your online study (pubication)
* Experiment safely without breaking working versions
* Share reproducible study code with collaborators
